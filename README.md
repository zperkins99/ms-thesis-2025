Thesis Title: On the Development of Self-Paced Treadmill Systems for Gait Research  
Completion Date: Spring 2025

Overview:  
This work explores the design, control and implementation of self-paced treadmill (SPT) systems to support human gait research. Work was completed to evaluate a previously designed SPT system in the Human Adaptation Lab at BU (original SPT system) as well as design and implement an updated SPT system in the lab for gait research.
