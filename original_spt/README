MATLAB FILES ARE COMPATIBLE WITH MATLAB/Simulink 2009a  
CODE WAS WRITTEN BY THE HAL SENIOR DESIGN TEAM (SPRING 2017) AND MODIFIED FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN FALL 2024 / SPRING 2025 FOR THESIS  

%=============================================================================%  
% FILES ASSOCIATED WITH DS1103 REAL-TIME CONTROL SYSTEM / DSPACE CONTROLDESK  %  
%=============================================================================%  
To get stream002.mat (used in controller.m) dSPACE CONTROLDESK is leveraged using the following files:  

ControlDesk Experiment Files:  
sd_control2.cdc  
sd_control2.cdd  
sd_control2.cdx  

Real-Time Simulink Compiled Model Files:  
SD_jf_median_control2.map  
SD_jf_median_control2.mdl: Model file that can be opened with MATLAB/Simulink, contains embedded functions data_parse4 and safety with self-pacing control logic  
SD_jf_median_control2.ppc  
sd_jf_median_control2.sdf  
SD_jf_median_control2.trc  

ControlDesk Layout File:  
median_zp.lay: Newly created layout file with logged data output incorporated into controller.m code for implementation  

%========================================%  
% FILES ASSOCIATED WITH TREADMILL REMOTE %  
%========================================%  
treadmill_remote.dll: Dynamic link library created from source files from treadmill manufacturer (32-bit)   
treadmill_remote.h: Header file  
loadTreadmillLibrary.m: Function to load dynamic link library for use in self-pacing control   
initialize.m: Function that creates treadmill connection (treadmill control panel must be set to be ready for remote connection)  
setSpeed.m: Function to set the speed and acceleration of the treadmill  
closeTreadmill.m: Function that closes treadmill connection and unloads .dll library  

%=====================================================================%  
% FILES FROM SENIOR DESIGN TEAM WITH MODIFICATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION %  
%=====================================================================%  
controller.m: Run to execute self-pacing treadmill control (ControlDesk must be streaming Simulink model outputs to stream002.mat file)
data_parse4.m: Embedded function of Simulink model that contains self-pacing control logic
safety.m: Embedded function of Simulink model that contains self-pacing control logic
