***** FILES ASSOCIATED WITH VICON SDK *****  
connectViconDataStream.m: Connects to real-time data stream from Vicon, Vicon Nexus software must be open on host computer  
pullForcePlateData.m: Leverages Vicon SDK to pull force plate data from Vicon DataStream in real time  
closeViconDataStream.m: Disconnects Vicon client  

AdaptBool.m: Function used in connectViconDataStream.m for output clarity (must be downloaded from Vicon: https://www.vicon.com/software/datastream-sdk/)  
dotNet folder files: Used in connectViconDataStream.m (must be downloaded from Vicon https://www.vicon.com/software/datastream-sdk/)  


***** FILES ASSOCIATED WITH TREADMILL REMOTE *****  
treadmill_remote.dll: Dynamic link library created from source files from treadmill manufacturer  
treadmill_remote.h: Updated header file  
treadmill_proto.m: MATLAB prototype file that defines the interface between MATLAB and functions in the treadmill_remote.dll. Avoids parsing the header file directly, resolving some compatibility issues I was running into (warnings that increased latency)  
treadmill_remote_thunk_pcwin64.dll: Thunk file generated by MATLAB acting as bridge between MATLAB and .dll library  

Notes: treadmill_proto.m and treadmill_remote_thunk_pcwin64.dll were generated by running the following command in MATLAB:  
  loadlibrary('treadmill_remote.dll', 'treadmill_remote.h', 'mfilename', 'treadmill_proto')  

loadTreadmillLibrary.m: Function to load dynamic link library for use in self-pacing control  
connectTreadmill.m: Function that creates treadmill connection (treadmill control panel must be set to be ready for remote connection)  
setTreadmillSpeed.m: Function to set the speed and acceleration of the treadmill  
closeTreadmill.m: Function that closes treadmill connection and unloads .dll library  


***** FILES ADAPTED FROM SONG ET AL. 2020 *****  
trackTreadmillSpeed.m: Function to track current treadmill speed  
stateEstimator.m: Function to estimate user position and velocity with Kalman filter  
calcTargetSpeed.m: Function to calculate updated treadmill speed based on control law and safety features  


***** OTHER *****  
controller.m: Run to execute self-pacing treadmill control  
filterForcePlateData.m: Function for filtering force plate data pulled from Vicon DataStream  
getUserMass.m: Function that uses pullForcePlateData.m to get user mass from force plate data  
getGRF: Function that uses pullForcePlateData.m and filterForcePlateData.m to getGRF input for state estimator  
saveData.m: Function that can be used to quickly re-structure data saved from controller runs (must be modified if data_save structure is modified in controller.m)
